INTRUSION-DETECTION-BIG-DATA

The proposed method evaluated by modern datases CICIDS2017, which contain a combination of common and modern attacks, the data sets are preprocessing to be suitable for the applying the machine learning techniques.

Step 1: Download Datasets

CICIDS2017 was released in late 2017 via Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC), where it contains benign and the most up-to-data common attacks.CICIDS2017 Dataset contains the most common attack based on the 2016 McAfee report (Dos, DDos, Web based, Brute force, Infiltration, Heart-bleed, Bot and Scan) with more than 80 features extracted from the generated network traffic.

Step 2: Preprocessing Datasets

1.Remove socket information: As the original dataset includes the IP address and Port numbers of the source and destination hosts in the network, it is important to remove such information to provide unbiased detection, where using such information may results in overfitted training toward this socket information. However, it is more important to let the classifier learn from the characteristics of the packet itself, so that, any host with similar packet information is filtered out regardless to its socket information.

2.Remove white spaces: Some of the multi-class labels in the dataset include white spaces. Such white spaces result in different classes as the actual value is different from the labels of other tuples in the same class.

3.Label encoding: The multi-class labels in the dataset are provided with the attackâ€™s names, which are strings values. Thus, it is important to encode these values into numerical values, so that, the classifier can learn the class number that each tuple belongs to. This operation is executed using the multi-class labels only, as the binary labels are already in zero-one formation.

4.Data normalization: The numerical data in the dataset are of different ranges, which poses some challenges to the classifier during training to compensate these differences. Thus, it is important to normalize the values in each attribute, so that, the minimum value in each attribute is zero, while the maximum is one. This provides more homogeneous values to the classifier while maintaining the relativity among the values of each attribute.

5- Remove / replace massing and infinity values: CICIDS2017 dataset contain 2,867 tuples as missing and infinity values, this has been addressed in two ways that s produces two datasets: the first, dataset is without the missing and infinite values, where is removed all missing and infinity values. the second dataset is replaced the infinite values with the maximum value and the missing values with the average values. Both datasets are used to evaluate the proposed method.
